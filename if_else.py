# # # Conditions and If statements
# # # Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

# # # Equals: a == b
# # # Not Equals: a != b
# # # Less than: a < b
# # # Less than or equal to: a <= b
# # # Greater than: a > b
# # # Greater than or equal to: a >= b
# # # These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

# # # An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

# # a=33
# # b=200

# # if b>a:
# #     print("B is Greater than a")

# # Elif
# # The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

# # # a = 33
# # # b = 33
# # # if b > a:
# # #   print("b is greater than a")
# # # elif a == b:
# # #   print("a and b are equal")

# # a=66
# # b=66

# # if a>b:
# #     print("a is greter ths n b")
# # elif a==b:
# # #     print("A and B is Equal")

# # # Else
# # # The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

# # a=45
# # b=100
# # if a>b:
# #     print("a is greter than b")
# # elif a==b:
# #     preint("a and b are equal ")
# # else:
# #     print("a and b is not equal")

# #SHORT hand if 
# # a=10
# # b=5
# # if a > b: print("its true")

# # And
# # The and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:
# # a=10
# # b=20
# # c=30
# # if a>b and b<c:
# #     print("a is less than b and b is less than c")
# # # # else:
# # # #     print("Somthing else")

# # # Or
# # # The or keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:


# # a=10
# # b=20
# # c=30
# # if a>b or b<c:
# #     print("At list one condition is need to tru ")

# # Not
# # The not keyword is a logical operator, and is used to reverse the result of the conditional statement:

# # a=10
# # b=20
# # if not a>b:
# #     print("a is not greteer than b")



# # Nested If
# # You can have if statements inside if statements, this is called nested if statements.

# # x=50
# # if x>10:
# #     print("Above ten")
# #     if x>20:
# #         print("and alaso above 20 ")
# #     else :
# #         print("but not  above 20!.")

# # The pass Statement
# # if statements cannot be empty, but if you for some 
# #reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

# a=33
# b=23
# if a>b:
#     pass
