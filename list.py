# #List are used multiple items in single variable
# thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# print(thislist)

# #Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:

# thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# print(len(thislist))

#List items can be of any data type:
# list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# # list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
# # list3 = [True, False, False]
# # print(list1)
# # # print(list2)
# # # print(list3)
# # # print(type(list1))

# # # The list() Constructor
# # thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
# # print(thislist)# possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.

# Python Collections (Arrays)
# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

# List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
# Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

#Access Items
#List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number:
# thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# print(thislist[0])
