# Conditions and If statements
# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b
# These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

# An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

# a=33
# b=200

# if b>a:
#     print("B is Greater than a")

# Elif
# The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

# a = 33
# b = 33
# if b > a:
#   print("b is greater than a")
# elif a == b:
#   print("a and b are equal")

a=66
b=66

# if a>b:
#     print("a is greter ths n b")
# elif a==b:
# #     print("A and B is Equal")

# # Else
# # The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

# a=45
# b=100
# if a>b:
#     print("a is greter than b")
# elif a==b:
#     preint("a and b are equal ")
# else:
#     print("a and b is not equal")

#SHORT hand if 
# a=10
# b=5
# if a > b: print("its true")

# And
# The and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:
# a=10
# b=20
# c=30
# if a>b and b<c:
#     print("a is less than b and b is less than c")
# # # else:
# # #     print("Somthing else")

# # Or
# # The or keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:


# a=10
# b=20
# c=30
# if a>b or b<c:
#     print("At list one condition is need to tru ")

# Not
# The not keyword is a logical operator, and is used to reverse the result of the conditional statement:

# a=10
# b=20
# if not a>b:
#     print("a is not greteer than b")



# Nested If
# You can have if statements inside if statements, this is called nested if statements.

# x=50
# if x>10:
#     print("Above ten")
#     if x>20:
#         print("and alaso above 20 ")
#     else :
#         print("but not  above 20!.")

# The pass Statement
# if statements cannot be empty, but if you for some 
#reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

# a=33
# b=23
# if a>b:
#     pass

# sachin = 498
# SACHIN =498

# if sachin == SACHIN:
#     print('SA')
