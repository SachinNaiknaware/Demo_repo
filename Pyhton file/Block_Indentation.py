# ##Block Indentation
# Python uses indentation to deﬁne control and loop constructs. This contributes to Python's readability, however, it
# requires the programmer to pay close attention to the use of whitespace. Thus, editor miscalibration could result in
# code that behaves in unexpected ways.
# Python uses the colon symbol (:) and indentation for showing where blocks of code begin and end (If you come
# from another language, do not confuse this with somehow being related to the ternary operator). That is, blocks in
# Python, such as functions, loops, if clauses and other constructs, have no ending identiﬁers. All blocks start with a
# colon and then contain the indented lines below it.

# def sachin():
#     a=2
#     return a
# print(sachin())

# b,a=10,12
# if a > b:
#     print(a)
# else:
#     print(b)
