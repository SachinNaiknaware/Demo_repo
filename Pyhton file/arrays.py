### array 
# array in python are not the arrays in conventional programming language like c and java  but closer to list.
# a list can be a collection of either homogeneous or heterogeneous  elements 

# Parameter    Details
# b            Represents signed integer of size 1 byte
# B            Represents unsigned integer of size 1 byte
# c            Represents character of size 1 byte
# u            Represents unicode character of size 2 bytes
# h            Represents signed integer of size 2 bytes
# H            Represents unsigned integer of size 2 bytes
# i            Represents signed integer of size 2 bytes
# I            Represents unsigned integer of size 2 bytes
# w            Represents unicode character of size 4 bytes
# l            Represents signed integer of size 4 bytes
# L            Represents unsigned integer of size 4 bytes
# f            Represents ﬂoating point of size 4 bytes
# d            Represents ﬂoating point of size 8 bytes


# from array import array
# my_array = array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
# print(my_array[0])  
# print(my_array[1])  
# print(my_array[2])  
# print(my_array[3])
# print(my_array[4])  
  



## array is data structure that stores vallue of same data type
## diffrence between array and list

## list                                       array
# list contain vallue corresponding           array can cantain same type of data type 
# to diffrent data type                       vallue


##Lists in lists


lst=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# print(lst[0])     #[1, 2, 3]
# print(lst[1])     #[4, 5, 6]
# print(lst[2])     #[7, 8, 9]
# print(lst[0][0])  1
# print(lst[1][2])  6

#also you can set the vallue inside the list
# lst[2]=[10,11,12]
# print(lst)       [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12]]
