# from array import array

## array is data structure that stores vallue of same data type
## diffrence between array and list

## list                                       array
# list contain vallue corresponding           array can cantain same type of data type 
# to diffrent data type                       vallue


##Lists in lists


lst=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# print(lst[0])     #[1, 2, 3]
# print(lst[1])     #[4, 5, 6]
# print(lst[2])     #[7, 8, 9]
# print(lst[0][0])  1
# print(lst[1][2])  6

#also you can set the vallue inside the list
# lst[2]=[10,11,12]
# print(lst)       [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12]]
